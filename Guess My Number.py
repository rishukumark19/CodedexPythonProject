#Build a Python program where the user tries to guess a random number within a specific range.
#The program will provide hints if the guess is too high or too low.
#The program should:
# Generate a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1â€“100).
# Allow the user to guess the number.
# Provide feedback after each guess (too high, too low, or correct).
# Track the number of attempts and display the result.
import random
